Testing this baby

Way back when I was an itty-bitty boy, living in a box under the stairs in the corner of a basement in a house half a block down the street from Gary's Bait Shop (you know the place), well anyway, life then was going swell and everything was just PEACHY. Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning, my mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast. A BIG BOWL OF SAUERKRAUT! EVERY SINGLE MORNING!
