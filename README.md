Testing this baby

Way back when I was an itty-bitty boy, living in a box under the stairs in the corner of a basement in a house half a block down the street from Gary's Bait Shop (you know the place), well anyway, life then was going swell and everything was just PEACHY. Except, of course, for the undeniable fact that every single morning, my mother would make me a big ol' bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast. A BIG BOWL OF SAUERKRAUT! EVERY SINGLE MORNING!
It was driving me crazy! So I said to my mom, I said, "Hey, Mom! What's up with all the sauerkraut?!" And my dearsome mother, she just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train. And she leaned right down next to me and she said, "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!" So she tied me to the wall, stuck a funnel in my mouth, and force-fed me nothing but sauerkraut 'till I was 26 1/2 years old.
