That's when I swore that someday, someday I would get out of that basement
and travel to a magical, far away place, where the sun is always shining,
and the air smells like warm root beer, and the towels are oh, so fluffy!
Where the shiners and the lepers play their ukeleles all day long and anyone
on the street would gladly shave your back for a nickel! WAKA WAKA DO DO YEAH!
