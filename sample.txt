That's when I swore that someday, someday I would get out of that basement
and travel to a magical, far away place, where the sun is always shining,
and the air smells like warm root beer, and the towels are oh, so fluffy!
Where the shiners and the lepers play their ukeleles all day long and anyone
on the street would gladly shave your back for a nickel! WAKA WAKA DO DO YEAH!

Well let me tell ya people, it wasn't long at all before my dream came true,
because the very next day a local radio station had this contest to see who
could correctly guess the number of molecules on Leonard Nemoy's butt. I was
off by three, but I still won the grand prize! That's right, a first-class,
one-way ticket to ALBUQUERQUE!

Ya know, I'd never been on a read airplane before, and I've gotta tell ya, it
was really great. Except I had to sit between two large Albanian woman with
excruciatingly severe body odor, the little kid in back of me threw up the
whole time, the flight attendants ran out of Dr. Pepper and salted peanuts,
the in-flight movie was Biodome with Pauly Shore, and, oh yeah, three of the
airplane engines burned out, and we went into a tail-spin, crashed into a
hillside and the plane exploded in a giant fireball, and everybody DIED!
Except for me! You know why? 'Cause I had my tray table up and my seatback in
the full upright position!
